## Overview
This project is my final assignment from the Dicoding web development course. It’s a personal storytelling website chronicling key moments in my first 20 years, designed to blend narrative with modern web design and responsiveness.

## Purpose

- Present personal milestones in a visually engaging and user-friendly format.

## Objectives
- Timeline-based layout that’s responsive across desktop and mobile devices.
- Interactive features to enhance viewer engagement (e.g., hover effects, animations).
- Clean code organization with separate folders for assets, styles, and scripts.
